- 👋 Hi, I’m Reynol Lopez
- 👀 I’m interested in developing new solutions. I like to make solutions based on ASP.Net Web Forms and MVC, .Net Forms, VB.Net, C#, Python and SQL Server. I have experience developing billing and collecting solutions. I'm currently converting some solutions I made from 2000 to 2010 to ASP.Net MVC and Python, just to have knowledge and experience under these technologies that I'm new on them.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, ASP.Net MVC, Android, PHP, MySQL.
- 💞️ With my current job, at this moment it's is hard for me to be involved on full time and complex solutions but I can give advice.
- 📫 You can reach me on ryolp@hotmail.com
